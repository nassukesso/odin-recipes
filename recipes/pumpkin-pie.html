    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Allrecipes community adores this pumpkin pie recipe because it's incredibly customizable, so you can easily alter the ingredient list to suit your needs. If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list.</p>
    <p>The assembled pumpkin pie should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important to let the pumpkin pie rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Meat: This super meaty pumpkin pie has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>

        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
